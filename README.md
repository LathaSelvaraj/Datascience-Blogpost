# Datascience-Blogpost
This repo consists of a notebook containing code for the project 4 of Udacity Data Science course.

This project is titled 'Write A Data Science Blog Post'.

The Stack Overflow 2017 survey data was used here in order to get information on professional developers and what to focus on to have the best career.

# Installation  
This project uses a Jupyter Notebook running Python 3 with the libraries numpy, pandas and matplotlib. These can be installed using pip but should be included in the Anaconda distribution of Python.

# Project Motivation
This project was written as part of the Udacity Become a Data Scientist course. I used the Stack Overflow survey data due to my interest in professional software developers.

# File Descriptions
Project1.ipynb contains the Python code for this project. It assumes that the survey data is in the same directory. This can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017 .

# Results
Throughout the notebook, I set out to answer three questions:

1. What are the most common languages, technologies, methodologies and tools used by professionals
2. What is the average salary for each programming language
3. Which programming language has the highest job satisfaction

We found out the following answers to the questions above:

The top 5 most commonly used languages are found to be Javascript, SQL, Java, C#, Python. To support this the most commonly used framework is also Java based skills. The most commonly used databases are SQL based and the most common methodology is Agile and Scrum.

Its interesting to see that the most common languages that we found are of a lower salaries and the least popular languages have higher average salaries. This could be because if less resouces are available in the market for a langugae then the salary and demand will also be high

Those who use less popular languages have higher job satisfaction but this may be a correlation between salary and job satisfaction.
